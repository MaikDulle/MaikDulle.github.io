## The Segmentation Lens: A Framework for Speaking the Same Language

### Why 5 departments give 5 different answers – and how to tackle it

Ever asked Marketing, CRM, Revenue Management, and Strategy who your customers are? Spoiler: you'll get wildly different answers. "Families." "Revenue above €5,000." "Cluster 7." "New customers." They're all correct – and that's exactly the problem.
This interactive framework visualizes segmentation as what it really is: not a single method, but a spectrum of structuring. Five distinct layers, from gut-feel intuition to academic theory, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

<br>

The framework offers two modes – a Storyline that walks you through a real-world cruise scenario (3,999 passengers, 5 departments, 5 perspectives), and an interactive Framework View where you can explore each segmentation layer in detail. Click a layer, see its guiding question, typical examples, and where it shines or falls short.
Built to bridge the gap between data teams and business stakeholders. Fully bilingual (EN/DE). No dependencies. Just one HTML file.

### The core insight?

The art isn't in choosing one layer. It's knowing when which lens delivers the greatest value. But see for yourself and if you like, give me feedback
